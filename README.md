# CUDA TCP Project Demo (for Windows) 

Simulate CUDA cpp code that receives data for for processing in GPU 
TCP / IP as major protocol 

In typical TCP/IP, we build it with 2 projects (server.cpp & client.cpp).

Instead here, is just simulating TCP/IP so we build it in 1 .cpp file using threading

## Requirements

CUDA Toolkit

Windows
